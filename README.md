## ‚ú® About This Project

This project serves as a starter kit for anyone looking to implement a structured architecture in their Flutter projects from day one. It solves the common problem of unorganized code by separating concerns into three main layers:

-   **Model:** Represents your data structures (e.g., `UserModel`, `MoviesModel`).
-   **View:** The UI of your application (Widgets, Screens). Its only job is to display what the ViewModel tells it to.
-   **ViewModel:** Acts as a bridge between the View and the Model. It handles all the business logic and state management.

## üéØ Key Features

-   **MVVM Architecture:** For a clean separation of UI, business logic, and data.
-   **Provider State Management:** Simple and effective state management solution.
-   **Repository Pattern:** To abstract the data layer from the rest of the app.
-   **Robust Network Layer:** A reusable service for making API calls (`GET`, `POST`) with a base class for easy switching between `http`, `dio`, etc.
-   **Custom Exception Handling:** Gracefully handle API errors and network issues.
-   **Centralized Navigation:** A clean routing system to manage all screen navigations from one place.
-   **Reusable Components:** Common widgets like `RoundButton` to maintain a consistent UI and avoid code duplication.

## üèóÔ∏è Architectural Flow

The data flow in this architecture is unidirectional and easy to follow:


1.  **View** triggers an event (e.g., button press).
2.  **ViewModel** catches the event, processes the business logic, and calls the **Repository**.
3.  **Repository** fetches data from the **API** or a local database.
4.  **ViewModel** receives the data and updates its state.
5.  **View**, which is listening to the ViewModel, automatically rebuilds to display the new state (e.g., show a loading spinner, data, or an error message).
